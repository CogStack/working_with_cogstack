# MedCAT Model Training

A MedCAT model will undergo Two steps of training.
The first is an unsupervised step which should only be done once.

The Supervised training step ("Human in the loop") should be done to fine-tune and evaluate models. 
This step can be an iterative process where models can be "further" fine-tuned to further its understanding of concepts.
