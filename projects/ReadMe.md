# Projects

This directory is a placeholder for where project workflows are organised and all relevant information relevant to a particular usecase is stored in a single location.

The [demo project structure](working_with_cogstack/projects/demo_project_stucture) is a template which you can copy and follow to meet the requirements of your usecase.

The majority of this information is also held throughout other sections of this repository and thus this section is simply an alternative workflow which keeps all relevant data and file pertaining to a project together.


The folder names should correspond to the project and project ID for easy reference.
