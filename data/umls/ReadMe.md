## About
The UMLS integrates and distributes key terminology, classification and coding standards,
 and associated resources to promote creation of more effective and interoperable biomedical information systems and services,
  including electronic health records.

The UMLS, or Unified Medical Language System, is a set of files and software that brings together many health and 
biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems.

## Access

[Request a license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/?_gl=1*1791eyk*_ga*MTkwNzE1ODcyOC4xNjYyOTcxNDg3*_ga_P1FPTH9PL4*MTY2Mjk3ODA3OS4yLjEuMTY2Mjk3OTQ4Mi4wLjAuMA..)

Documentation for User Authentication can be found [here](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/authentication.html)


For further information about UMLS API Technical Documentation can be found [here.](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/home.html)


### Downloading UMLS

One can use the scripts found in [NLM_umls_download.py](data/umls/NLM_umls_download.py) to download the entire UMLS 
Knowledge Source.

Otherwise, one can access the UMLS Knowledge Sources directly: File Downloads can be found [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html)

Alternatively, you can simply follow the scripts in the [working with UMLS notebook](data/umls/working_with_umls.ipynb). This script will download UMLS and convert the
 MRCONSO.RFF.ZIP file to a DataFrame. You can then process this file to get ready to build a MedCAT Concept Database!
