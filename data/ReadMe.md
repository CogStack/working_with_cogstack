# Storage location for all data/models

To keep the repository clean all data and models should be stored here in their appropriate folder.

This directory has been organised to assist in the workflow of Working with [CogStack](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-NiFi)
 and creating/evaluating [MedCAT models](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT).

## Retrieval and Storage of Data
All raw data relating to a CogStack request. Should be stored here


## SNOMED

Place holder for all SNOMED related content and downloads [here](/data/snomed).
For other terminologies (UMLS/RxNORM etc...) please create a separate folder and store them within this directory.

## MedCAT Models

All model components and model packs should be stored [here](/data/medcat_models)


## MedCATtrainer 

All MedCATtrainer JSON exports should be stored [here](data/medcattrainer_export).
Scripts to produce export summaries of all annotations and work done, can be found [here](TODO: ).
